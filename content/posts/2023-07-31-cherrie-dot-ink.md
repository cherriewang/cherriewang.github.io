## Cherrie Dot Ink!

It's not written with physical ink but here it is nonetheless! A digital diary to collect my musings and current happenings.

It has been a very long time since I've opened up a file and fiddled with html and cssâ€” but thanks to some helpful pointers from other smart people on the internet, BEHOLD. A blog up and running that is  working just fine. 
We're past the halfway point of 2023, so not really the time for New Year's resolutions but... as I've been on a little hiatus and enjoying some summer holiday time, I found the energy to finally put together a space for my thoughts on the internet.  So now we have a half-year resolution to write weekly at the very least.


Where did this spring up from? Well, in recent days (and weeks), I've been visiting and re-visiting some of my favorite blogs on the internet. Personal blogs are one of those old internet things that are timeless and wonderful. It inspired me to finally put together a public-facing one of my own. I can't say this one is really all that personalized yet (the default minima theme has me stumped already) but I'm optimistic that as I continue to populate it, the space will evolve as well :) 


I also want to set my intention as clearly as I can. There are two main goals here:
Document publicly! For drawing, for learning, for reading. 
Write more clearly and concisely. For an audience! ðŸ˜±


You know how I do love to rambleâ€”here's hoping I become more coherent over time! That's it for now, then.
