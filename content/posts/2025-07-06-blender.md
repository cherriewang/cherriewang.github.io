## Blender— on the back burner no more!

I'm starting my Blender journey! So far, it's been three days, and I've made one ramen bowl, following [Azusa Tojo's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kpjaEU8cPU&ab_channel=AzusaTojo). This ramen bowl took me approximately 5 hours to complete, and an almost meltdown in the middle ... (haha!)

Anyway, I thought to write this blog post because I want to remember this journey— especially the beginning, when everything is the most frustrating it can be. It's been a long time since I've learned how to do something from scratch, and one of the things I've always found fascinating is the documentation of self-study. 

The main mental notes I took down over the last few days are as follows:
1. It is hard to learn. It is hard to problem solve. And it is very hard to navigate in a program that is unfamiliar, and try to memorize shortcuts before you know what the actions are even doing. All of this takes reps on reps on reps, like a sport. I am training my brain in a way it doesn't usually think (ie. sculpting 3d polygons) and burning this new knowledge into neural pathways so they can be accessed later on without the crutch of a tutorial. This is deeply difficult. It's no wonder that everyone wants to reach for a shortcut!
2. But! It is SO rewarding. It took me 5 hours of sweat (literally I was sweating) to make my shitty ramen bowl. In less than 2 minutes, I can prompt gemini for something similar, and it will give me an image in less time than it takes for me to open a Blender file on my computer. Yet I felt nothing when I looked at the image it spat out to me. No sense of accomplishment, no pride, it's simply a piece of candy handed to me for free. I am no more capable of any skill before and after the prompt. On the other hand, that ramen bowl I made? Words can't describe the feeling of finishing that on my own :)
3. Okay, but we're not just going off to learn blender so that we have a sense of accomplishment, right? The real question is: what is my goal? What am I actually trying to pursue here? 
**Here's my answer:**
What I really want is freedom. I want to have the freedom to open this tool and sculpt with confidence. I want to know how I made every shape, and own the decision behind it in a way that I don't think AI could ever truly deliver. I want expand my art-making arsenal and be able to create simple, beautiful sets to storyboard in, and maybe even start to animate on my own in Blender. 

It's daunting to dive into the ocean of Blender educational content on the web. Literally every artist under the sun has attempted this at some point in their life, and with confidence I can say that most drop off. So... how will I stay afloat and achieve my goals? 

I found this [reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/101z60g/a_roadmap_for_learning_blender3d/) on r/blender and it really resonated with me. The path feels clear. It is scoped and it is do-able, in fact, I have already begun doing it a la that first ramen bowl tutorial (note: definitely should have picked something easier to start with). 

> 1. Do beginners tutorials. I cannot stress this enough. Not only will this save you a great deal of time and frustration, but probably from rage quitting as well. Even if they don't teach you the specific thing you want, after doing the beginners tutorials you will at least have a feel for the program, understand the basic navigation controls and have the vocabulary to ask the right questions. Make notes as you go, particularly of hot keys. This is the the monkey-see-monkey-do phase.
> 
> 2. Repeat the tutorial from memory. Makes notes on the bits that didn't stick the first time that you have to look up. This is the challenge, how much can you remember?
> 
> 3. Now make something similar, but not the same. Similar in that you don't need tools you haven't learned yet, but not the same so you have to start making your own choices. Instead of a donut, make a cupcake or something. This is what forces you to not just get stuck with the tutorials.
> 
> 4. Move on to the next tutorial. Give each one your best shot, and move on. These are learning exercise, sketches, not finished masterpieces, don't get stuck obsessing over it at this stage as repetition of the basics is key and you won't get to do that by spending hours obsessing over one settings. Save that for later.
> 
> 5. Doodle. Spend a part of your allocated daily time with blender just messing about with what you know so far. Don't think about "making a project" that brings all kinds of expectations with it you don't need. Just doodle in 3D.
> 
> 6. Ask questions. No one minds helping those who are making an effort. Tell us what you are doing, what you expected to happen, what did happen, what you did to try and fix it. Post a screenshot and include the whole Blender window - a picture speaks a thousand words. (If you are tempted to whip out your mobile phone right now, STOP, go and look up how to do screen shots eh?)
> 
> 7. Don't get discouraged. Your ability to see what looks goods will advance more quickly than your ability to actually do it. This should be expected. Also don't compare yourself to others, the only measure of progress that counts is, do you know something today that you didn't yesterday? Can you do something better today than you did yesterday? The rest is bullshit.
> 
> Remember that these initial tutorials are about learning Blender and its tools and workflows, don't get put off because you don't want to make donuts, the subject matter is circumstantial. Once you're comfortable with the interface and the basic tools then use your end goal to direct what tutorials you do after. Most tutorials are not aimed at beginners and you will likely not have a clue what's going on without some familiarity with the UI. I would personally recommend doing at least BlenderGurus Donut, Chair and Anvil tutorials before diving into more specific material. Other people will suggest other good sources but these are the ones I've done so can recommend.
