Periodically, I identify areas or subjects of drawing that I&rsquo;d like to improve at. Most recently, it&rsquo;s bears. The resulting action is usually me taking a few days to sit with it and grind through a lot of drawings—though most of this never sees the light of day.

The thing about this practice though, is that it&rsquo;s usually relegated to some throwaway sketchbook that  I promptly forget about&mldr;whereas I&rsquo;ve always thought it would be more valuable if I could collect the learnings so I could revisit them to get a refresher.
