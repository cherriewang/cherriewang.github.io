I think I’ll need one more session to really get it in, and maybe some more freehand on my own on paper.

It’s the kind of sketch you can spend a long time looking at, it just has such appeal. He storyboarded on Brother Bear 2, and I believe this is a beatboard from a sequence he did. From what I could see in the faint construction lines, he also does a circle to ground the head first. It’s much smaller than mine though. I think it’s literally to just help with the eyes? Interesting, as I was a doing a copy, it felt easier to go eyes first, then build out the snout. He also stretches the anatomy more than the actual animated frames, and it results in a more impassioned drawing.\nMore studies from John’s boards. Gosh, they’re just so charming…his drawings. Even the simplest ones have clear shapes and translate movement so well. Hope I can keep some of the looseness he has in these for my future boards.\n","wordCount":"457","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-08-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-08-02T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Cherrie Wang"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://cherrie.ink/posts/2023-08-02-brother-bear/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Digital Sketch Notes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cherrie.ink/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://cherrie.ink/ accesskey=h title="Digital Sketch Notes (Alt + H)">Digital Sketch Notes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://cherrie.ink/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cherrie.ink/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cherrie.ink/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Brother Bear</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-08-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 2, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;Cherrie Wang</div></header><div class=post-content><p>Some studies from Brother Bear and also John Nevarez.
